We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to change or modify portions of these Terms of Service at any time If we do this, we will post the change(s) on this page and will indicate at the top of this page the date these terms were last revised. We will also notify you, either through the Services user interface, in an email notification or through other reasonable means. Any such changes will become effective no earlier than fourteen (14) days after they are posted, except that changes addressing new functions of the Services or changes made for legal reasons will be effective immediately. Your continued use of the Service after the date any such changes become effective constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms of Service.</p>
    <p>In addition, when using certain services, you will be subject to any additional terms applicable to such services that may be posted on the Service from time to time, including, without limitation, the Privacy Policy located at <a class="Button--inline" href="http://www.realpal.io/privacy">www.realpal.io/privacy</a>. All such terms are hereby incorporated by reference into these Terms of Service.</p>
    <p><strong>THESE TERMS OF SERVICE INCLUDE A CLASS ACTION WAIVER AND REQUIRE BINDING ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS TO RESOLVE DISPUTES. DETAILS ARE SET FORTH BELOW IN THESE TERMS OF SERVICE.</strong></p>

    <h3>Access and Use of the Service</h3>
    <p><strong>Services and Membership Description:</strong> The Service is designed to provide men and women with great clothes (“items”) selected by our personal stylists from time to time (each shipment of items, a “trunk”). Once you create an account, you will become a “Member.” For more details about the Service, please see <a class="Button--inline" href="http://www.realpal.io/">www.realpal.io</a>. With each trunk, you have five (5) days after it is delivered to review the selection of items and try them on (“try-on period”). Each trunk that we ship to you will include a non-refundable $25 fee that will be credited towards any purchase within that trunk (“styling fee”). We charge you for all items not returned in accordance with the Return Policy, below, at the end of the try-on period, although we may bill you earlier in certain circumstances (for example, if you return your trunk before the try-on period is over, if you request us to, if we have reason to believe that the order is fraudulent, if there has been a pattern of credit issues, or if we notify you that we will do so). There are no order minimums or long-term ordering commitments. You may suspend your Membership at any time by contacting Real Pal customer support at service@realpal.io. To protect you and Real Pal from fraud, Real Pal may contact you from time to time to verify your identity prior to sending you a trunk. You may be asked to provide basic information about yourself to verify your Member account. Upon confirmation of your identity, Real Pal will send you a trunk. Real Pal reserves the rights to terminate your membership, to refuse any and all current or future use of the Site or the Service, and not to do business with any Member or anyone else, each as Real Pal deems appropriate in its sole discretion for any reason.</p>
    <p><strong>Return Policy; Shipping:</strong> You may return any item from a particular trunk you receive through the Service (in accordance with the instructions below and those provided with such trunk) within five (5) days after it is delivered. For free returns, any items must be returned using the pre-paid return label and box provided by Real Pal, and items must be unworn (other than “tried-on”), in their original condition and include all original tags and packaging. Shipping is not available to all locations. Members will not be charged fees for shipping or return shipping, except in special circumstances (where we will give you advance notice) All items you receive through the Service will be shipped by a third-party carrier.</p>
    <p><strong>Gift Certificates:</strong> The purchase of a Real Pal gift certificate cannot be redeemed for cash, except to the extent required by applicable law. Real Pal gift certificates cannot be resold and are otherwise non-transferrable.</p>
    <p><strong>Referral Rewards:</strong> We invite and encourage Members to earn certain rewards (e.g., credits toward future purchases from Real Pal) (“Referral Rewards”) when they invite friends to become Members and those friends make a qualifying purchase from Real Pal. Your earning and redeeming of Referral Rewards (the “Referral Rewards Program”) is governed by these Terms of Service. Please see more details on our current Referral Rewards Program at <a class="Button--inline" href="http://www.realpal.io/invite">www.realpal.io/invite</a>.</p>
    <p>This offer is limited to one referral and email address per friend, although there is no limit to the number of friends you can invite.</p>
    <p>You may not spam or send unsolicited emails to persons you do not personally know to collect Referral Rewards and you may not collect Referral Rewards by posting on message boards or other online venues in violation of such venues’ terms of use. You agree that your fraudulent or misleading referral activity (for example, by inviting fake people to join Real Pal, using false names, using multiple email accounts or email addresses to sign up for the Service, impersonating another person or otherwise providing false or misleading information to us) or otherwise trying to circumvent the Referral Rewards Program is a violation of these Terms of Service, which may result in the voiding of your Referral Rewards and termination of your account. In such case, you may also be liable for civil and/or criminal penalties under applicable law.</p>
    <p>Referral Rewards cannot be resold and are otherwise non-transferrable. If we terminate the Referral Rewards Program, all Referral Rewards will be cancelled 30 calendar days after termination of the Referral Rewards Program is announced. For more information about the termination of the Service or any portion thereof (including the Referral Rewards Program), please see the Termination section, below.</p>
    <p>Real Pal reserves the right in its sole discretion at any time to change or modify the terms applicable to the Referral Rewards Program. Such changes may include without limitation, the specific type of reward, how you may earn and spend Referral Rewards, how long Referral Rewards last, minimum purchase amounts with which rewards may be used and the lifetime maximum amount of rewards that you may earn. If we do this, we will post the changes to these terms on this page and will indicate at the top of this page the date these terms were last revised. We will also notify you, either through the Services user interface, in an email notification or through other reasonable means. Any such changes will become effective no earlier than fourteen (14) days after they are posted, except that changes addressing new functions of the Referral Rewards Program or changes made for legal reasons will be effective immediately. Your continued use of the Referral Rewards Program after the date any such changes become effective constitutes your acceptance of the new terms.</p>

    <h3>Dispute Resolution By Binding Arbitration: PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY AS IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.</h3>
    <p>Most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to the customer’s satisfaction by emailing customer support at service@realpal.io. <strong>In the unlikely event that our customer care team is unable to resolve a complaint you may have (or if Real Pal has not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after attempting to do so informally), we each agree to resolve those disputes through binding arbitration, mediation, or small claims court instead of in courts of general jurisdiction.</strong> Arbitration, which is often cheaper, faster and less formal than a lawsuit in court, uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. Also, in any arbitration under this arbitration provision in which you seek less than $75,000 in damages, Real Pal will pay reasonable attorneys’ fees should you prevail. Real Pal will not seek attorneys’ fees from you. However, if you initiate an arbitration in which you seek more than $75,000 in damages, the payment of attorneys’ fees will be governed by the AAA Rules (as defined below). <strong>Any arbitration under this Agreement will take place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted.</strong></p>

    <h3>Arbitration Agreement</h3>
    <p>Real Pal and you agree to arbitrate <strong>all disputes and claims </strong>between us. This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted. It includes, but is not limited to:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory;</li>
      <li>claims that arose before this or any prior agreements (including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising);</li>
      <li>claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class; and</li>
      <li>claims that may arise after the termination of this Terms of Service.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>References to "Real Pal", "you", and "us" include our respective subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services or devices under this or prior agreements between us. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may bring an individual action in small claims court. This arbitration agreement does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state or local agencies, including, for example, the Federal Communications Commission. Such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf. You agree that, by entering into this Terms of Service, you and Real Pal are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. This Terms of Service evidences a transaction in the interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of this Terms of Service.</p>
    <p>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute ("Notice"). The Notice to Real Pal should be addressed to 325 West Ohio Street, Chicago IL 60654 ("Notice Address"). The Notice must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought ("Demand"). If Real Pal and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within sixty (60) calendar days after the Notice is received, you or Real Pal may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by Real Pal or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or Real Pal is entitled.</p>
    <p>The arbitration will be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, "AAA Rules") of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), as modified by this Terms of Service, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules are available online at adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by writing to the Notice Address. The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Terms of Service. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including, but not limited to, issues relating to the scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of the arbitration provision. Unless Real Pal and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in a reasonably convenient location for both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, the determination shall be made by AAA. If your claim is for $10,000 or less, we agree that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If your claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based. Real Pal will pay all AAA filing, administration, and arbitrator fees for any arbitration initiated in accordance with the AAA Rules. However, if you initiate an arbitration in which you seek more than $75,000 in damages, the payment of these fees will be governed by the AAA rules.</p>
    <p>The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees and expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.</p>
    <p>The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim. <strong>YOU AND TRUNK CLUB AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. </strong>Further, unless both you and Real Pal agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void.</p>
    <p>Notwithstanding any provision in this Terms of Service to the contrary, we agree that if Real Pal makes any future change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to the Notice Address) while you are a user of the Real Pal Web Site, you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within thirty (30) calendar days of the change to the Arbitration Notice Address provided above. By rejecting any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language of this provision.</p>
